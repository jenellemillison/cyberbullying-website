# cyberbullying-website

## Site is live at https://stopcyberbullying.online.

## Description
These scripts contain HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP for a website to display cyberbullying data. It is hosted on Railway with the domain certificates through CloudFlare.

## Project Files
- index.php is the home page file with all the php for the site.
- The assets/images folder stores images and videos used on the site.
- The assets/js folder stores code for the searchbar and scrolling features.
- The assets/css folder stores style.css which is the styleguide for this project.
- The assets/vendor folders are bootstrap css, icons, and formatting used by this project.

## Additional Files
- summaryStatsGen.sql is to create the table in the database for the summary statistics of cyberbullying (the numbers and percents). You can access the database using the provided environment variables. If you require plaintext database connection information, contact the developers.

## Installation
Simply clone this repository from the root.  All the scripts should be installed in one folder.

## Prerequisites
- IDE for web development (we used Dreamweaver).

## Usage
