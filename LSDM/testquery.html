How much is he asking for that no one wants to pay it??</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>GridironCards</td><td>Russell Wilson #/10 2012 Topps Supreme RC ROOKIE AUTOGRAPH AUTO Booklet SEAHAWKS  #ad #thehobby  https://t.co/oFSWTKcAeJ</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>Super_Nerd00</td><td>@RatedRev Think about what the Broncos were willing to give for Russell Wilson…. How much is he asking for that everyone is out that quick?</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>ItsTheJags</td><td>@TLawwwwwww @E_Dilla You’re putting it all on the line for Russell Wilson? Get out of here.</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>zane_duty</td><td>@DacostaAdrian Yall are complaining about the Saints getting a card...Russell played like dog shit last year and he got a 97. Granted I'm not saying that Andy Dalton deserves the card but neither did Wilson. EA just decides to give shit players cards because they don't watch football.</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>JustinB95777173</td><td>@Realrclark25 They paid kyler Murray who stinks a ton of money and he's black 

Watson raped 30 people and he's got 200M 

Russell wilson might be the worst qb in the afc and he's black and got over 200Ms 

I don't think the race card works here</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>ethnicity</td></tr><tr><td>FootballGirlAna</td><td>@Brickwallblitz Thank you for releasing on the anniversary of the Russell Wilson trade. Seahawks twitter looks forward to the drop </td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>CGeorgewise78</td><td>@Realrclark25 This is a stupid comment because it’s not about race. If it was then why was Deshaun Watson overpaid Kyler Murray overpaid and look what happened with Russell Wilson last year getting all that money from the Broncos and doing nothing maybe it’s about Lamars 1-3 playoff record</td><td>2023-03-08</td><td>not_cyberbullying</td></tr><tr><td>WHAS11</td><td>SO SWEET Russell Wilson dressed to impress his 5-year-old daughter Sienna Princess in a matching pink suit as he escorted her to her first dance.
